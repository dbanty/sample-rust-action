# sample-rust-action

An example GitHub Action written in Rust, generated from [dbanty/rust-github-action-template](https://github.com/dbanty/rust-github-action-template). You can either use this GitHub template and customize it yourself, or `cargo generate dbanty/rust-github-action-template` to create a new repo from this template. Any issues should be opened in the upstream template.

## TODO

- [ ] Update this README with the details of this action
- [ ] Update inputs/outputs in `action.yaml`
- [ ] Implement the action's logic in `src/main.rs`
- [ ] Rename the default Git branch to `v1` (instead of `main` or `master`. This helps with potential future breaking changes. **PROVIDED ACTIONS WILL NOT WORK UNTIL YOU DO THIS**
